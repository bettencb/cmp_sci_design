> Description: Lab work done on the Quartus SoC boards. Have main.c file attached to a workflow on GitHub for auto-creation
of binary files. There will be a branch for each main.c that is different (i.e. - used in another lab) and branches should
should be named in reference to the _Lab number_ and the **README** within each Lab branch will contain the description for 
what the lab is intended for.

      Lab 3 covers how to perform measurments on code execution time on the Quartus SoC hps boards.
